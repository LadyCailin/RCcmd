# though, but the source is fairly easy to read, so if you don't understand one,
# just look in the source code. if you've really got problems, just contact me
# on IRC, which can be found in the README.md
# i realise some values like servername and maxplayers could be found through get_server_info()
# but, my version of commandhelper seems to have it bugged. not sure why, though.
