# rccmd
***a very lightweight and slim replacement for craftbukkit "general" plugins.***

## what is this?
rccmd is a collection of scripts for [CommandHelper](http://wiki.sk89q.com/wiki/CommandHelper). It was created for a private Minecraft server I help run, because me and the owner both agreed that CommandBook, our previous "general commands" plugin was too bloated for our tastes now, and we have been trying to keep our server a very vanilla-Minecraft experience. I suggested that we try out CommandHelper, and we make our own commands, thus this was born.

## what makes this better than [Essentials](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-modes/Essentials), or [CommandBook](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/CommandBook)?
Nothing, I suppose. It was created because it was less bloated, and gave me a nice project. I personally think both of them are too big. Maybe it's just more vanilla-ish? More lightweight? You tell me.
