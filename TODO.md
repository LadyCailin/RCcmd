## TODO ##
- convert all scripts to use new styles
- set moving cancellation on /spawn and other commands like it
- localization?
- combine all message variables into one array.
- \<__import__\> ie, you'd have assign(@lang, 'en'), then in your translate(), it'd check @lang
    - something like that yeah
- possible command chooser website: think of painterly pack's texture pack customizer or commandbook's old module-selector
- remove useless 'true' in if statements.
